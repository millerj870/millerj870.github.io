## Selling My Brewing Tools

I've been homebrewing for almost 25 years.  I started brewing extract kits and eventually learned the skill of all grain brewing.  Living in rual America before the craft beer explosion, homebrewing was the most enjoyable way to get fresh, excellent beer.  Now that I live in Southern California, fresh affordable beer is a short walk from home, and my homebrewing kit has been gathering dust.  It's time my trusty gear find another home so it can help someone else enjoy this craft.

This web page lists my gear that is for sale.  As items sell, I will mark them sold here.  (When the number of sold items grows enough, I'll make a separate 'sold' section for the page.)

Each item is listed with an Item Name (linked to the listing of a new comparable item and where possible, where I bought it), some notes, an asking price, and a recent picture (taken in my garage with a sheet as backdrop) -- click on the pic for a larger version.  *I am willing to entertain any reasonable offers on this stuff.*  It really wants to find a new home.
