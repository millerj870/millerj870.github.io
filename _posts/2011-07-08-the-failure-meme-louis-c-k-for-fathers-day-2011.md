title: 'The Failure Meme: Louis C. K. for Father''s Day 2011'

I think that there's a failure meme in the air, and several people are expressing it. Many who have put the meme into words are entrepreneurs, or people who are working at the frontiers of our economy (the frontiers that are being created by new technology). In this video essay for CBS Sunday Morning, Louie C. K. talks about being a father in a way that acknowledges that most of us (fathers) are making this up as we go along. And that's OK so long as we understand why we're doing it in the first place. <p /> <iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/KJI8wLao1yY?wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen frameborder="0" height="417" width="500"></iframe>

_Edit_:  (26 December 2021) I was once a fan.  But Louis C.K. turns my stomach, now.
