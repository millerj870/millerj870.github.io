Just saw [this](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/02/06/want_to_hack_a_car_20_in_parts_some_oily_fingers_and_its_yours/) in a [Slashdot](http://www.slashdot.org) post: it appears someone can demonstrate how to take advantage of a modern car's lack of internal 'network' security if you have access to the car and a low-cost bit of tech that isn't too hard to assemble.

Your car may now be vulnerable.

Addition:  The FBI is [weighing in](http://www.ic3.gov/media/2016/160317.aspx), now.
