A long, long, long time ago, when I was first learning about git and was regularly reading [LifeHacker](), I discovered and started using a script that would add rich content to a git commit message.  For the last couple weeks, I’ve been trying to figure out what that script was called.  I associated it with the Lifehacker founder Gina Trapani and the author and activist Cory Doctorow, but that’s about all I could remember.  Today, I decided to ask the Twitter hivemind for help and posted this.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ages ago, <a href="https://twitter.com/ginatrapani?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ginatrapani</a> (Lifehacker) and maybe <a href="https://twitter.com/doctorow?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@doctorow</a> shared a CLI script for logging your work with information on what you were doing at the time (the music playing at the time, the weather, etc). I can&#39;t for the life of me remember the name of the script. Can anyone help?</p>&mdash; Jason &quot;Je Suis Antifa&quot; Miller (@jasonemiller) <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonemiller/status/1415753920102625280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 15, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Minutes later, I received this Tweet in response.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Flashbake</p>&mdash; Cory Doctorow (@doctorow) <a href="https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1415754805373378561?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 15, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

From the creator himself!

A Google search revealed that a version is still alive and being maintained (as of mid-2020) in Github here:  [flashbake](https://github.com/cmdln/flashbake).

Now I need to download it and start using it again. This should be fun.

## Update: macports

Flashbake is actually a package in macports!
