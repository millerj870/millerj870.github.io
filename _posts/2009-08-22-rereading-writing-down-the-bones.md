This was one of the first books on writing that I read seriously in the 80s. It started my addiction to books on writing, fountain pens, and writing. I remember the author's admonition to 'write everyday if you can' just like a runner runs every day, and to not have high expectations of preconceptions of what you are going to produce. This book had a deep and lasting impact on me and the way I think about writing. I'm looking forward to reading it again and being re-inspired to re-engage. <a href="http://nitro5.goodreads.com/review/list/2399128-jason-miller">View all my reviews >></a>
