Although the wholesale persecution of religion has eased significantly in China, the state still maintains a firm grip on organized religious practice, and it is especially wary of the challenge presented by papal authority.

Today's [NYTimes.com](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/09/world/asia/09china.html?hp) has a story about the Vatican's public excommunication of newly ordained bishop in China. Turns out that such excommunications are _de facto_ when the Vatican hasn't approved a bishop for ordination, but the Vatican's public objection is note worthy.
