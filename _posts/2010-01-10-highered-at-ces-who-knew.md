I had no idea until I read <a href="http://ow.ly/L0Hq">this article</a> and followed <a href="http://bit.ly/59zc5M">this link</a> that there was a Higher Education conference at this year's Consumer Electronics Show (CES). If I had known, I might have gone! 

Will such a conference/meeting will happen at next year's CES?
