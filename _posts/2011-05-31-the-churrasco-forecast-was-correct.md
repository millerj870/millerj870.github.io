In the face of wind and rain, thunder and lightning, and metric boatload of mud at the 2nd annual McGinnis Memorial Meat Marathon, Karl and I walked away with the traveling trophy, pictured below. &nbsp;About thirty pounds of meat (thanks, Costco) passed through the loving heat of our churrasco grill. Pork tenderloin, back ribs, and some prime ribeye roasts pleased the crowds and the judges. 

This award-winning team is available for birthdays, retirements, family reunions, and corporate catering.
