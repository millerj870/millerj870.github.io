## A little good news and a little bad news

  Docs report that the test came back for [myasthenia gravis](https://www.medicinenet.com/myasthenia_gravis/article.htm#what_is_myasthenic_crisis_what_are_the_symptoms_and_signs_is_it_life_threatening), and the test was positive.  The bad news is that it's a serious thing.  The good news is that it's a concrete thing.  Docs also said they put in a referral to the Mayo Clinic. 

## Update #1: 8:51pm

A second bit of good news today.  Received a call around dinner from Jack's hematologist (blood doctor).  He reported that results were in on some tests and that the results showed that there is no issue of blood cancers.

Two reports today mean that the puzle pieced might be fitting together, finally.  We aren't sure that that picture is showing, but our faith is growing that the medical professionals will be able to see it soon and tell us.
