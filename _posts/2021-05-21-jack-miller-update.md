## A little good news and a little bad news

  Docs report that the test came back for [myasthenia gravis](https://www.medicinenet.com/myasthenia_gravis/article.htm#what_is_myasthenic_crisis_what_are_the_symptoms_and_signs_is_it_life_threatening), and the test was positive.  The bad news is that it's a serious thing.  The good news is that it's a concrete thing.  Docs also said they put in a referral to the Mayo Clinic.
