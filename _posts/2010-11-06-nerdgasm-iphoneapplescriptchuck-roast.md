What this?  It's a picture I pulled up on my iPhone while I was at Home Depot this morning with the family.  The picture appeared in my Dropbox.  It was created by my laptop at home using an Applescript that had my iSight cam take a photo every 90 seconds.  This allowed me to keep an eye on the temperature of my chuck roast that was in my smoker on the deck.

I'll post more on how I did this, someday.
