Wish I would have been at South-By-Southwest just to see this presentation and to interact with the crowd that it attracted.

**[Universities in the "Free" Era - SXSW 2010 Presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/glenn.platt/universities-in-the-free-era-sxsw-2010-presentation)**

I'll have to write down some more thoughts about this later, but for now: first 50 slides are frightening, but the last 30 slides have lots that make me think, "We're trying to do that at Truman through the mathematical biology program and the efforts of the STEP Office." Made me feel a bit better. But it's all still pretty frightening.
