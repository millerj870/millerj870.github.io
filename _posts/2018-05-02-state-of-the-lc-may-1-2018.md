With the windshield wiper fluid delivery system fixed, and with an appointment to bring the rig in for “Shady” to look at it and quote a price for maintenance work (e.g., timing belt, t-case), I’ve been mulling over the list of things that need to get done. I missed an obvious one (_e.g._, radio antenna) and have some aspirational items to add.

The tasks on my list (not in any particular order):

  1. get the timing belt and transfer case looked at

  2. address some upholstery problems (holes and small rips) to stop them from becoming a bigger problem,

  3. looking for salvage yards that might have compatible rigs with some plastic parts I need to replace (_e.g._, lid to fusebox under the hood, cover for compartment on passenger side of the 3rd row seating, tie-down ‘wingnut’ piece that covers a screw in the cargo area)

  4. working up the courage (and saving the money) for stereo upgrade

  5. adding a simple aux battery to the rig; running some outlets for USB chargers

  6. converting some interior lights to LEDs (will use products from [pfran](http://www.pfranleds.com))

  7. find some folks in my local area (Ventura County) who are interested in some day trips to trails in the Los Padres Wilderness or surrounding areas. I want to meet some people and strengthen some trail driving skills so I can overland camp with confidence with my rig

  8. tires are getting worn, so need to consider replacing them with something that balances smooth road ride, fuel efficiency, and effectiveness for overland camping (which isn’t the same as rock crawling)

  9. remove the airfoil and consider removing the roof rack

  10. remove the running boards and, perhaps, replace with sliders; without running boards and sliders, it sounds like people recommend mud flaps (here's a link to the part numbers on ih8mud: [OEM Front Mudflaps](https://forum.ih8mud.com/threads/oem-front-mudflaps-w-part-numbers.698687/))

  11. fix antenna mast, perhaps replacing it with a manual mast (?)

  12. add bolts to engine cover (two are missing, two are present)

  13. have headlights aimed, perhaps replacing the bulbs (instructions for aiming are [here](https://forum.ih8mud.com/threads/numbers-for-aiming-headlights.524503/#post-7016021))
