title: Poking fun at Corporate-speak Email Footers
tags: 
---

In the `90s, the nerds on the internets were all concerned about the automated sniffing of email text being carried out by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echelon_(signals_intelligence">Echelon</a>, the NSA's signals intelligence collection and analysis network. Many people started adding terms to email footers that were believed to trigger Echelon. There were <a href="http://slashdot.org/story/99/10/18/1419245/October-21-is-Jam-Echelon-Day">Echelon Days</a> identified for this effort. People wrote scripts that appended trigger words to every email they sent.

Today, I saw [this post](http://www.economist.com/node/18529895) about the annoying footers that we're getting in emails from lawyers, Universities, businesses, and other haughty organizations. You know the footers. 

>In the event that this email is protected by client-attorney privilege and you are neither the attorney or client, you must delete the email under penalty of law." There are all sorts of variations on this.

The post I just linked strongly suggests that these appendices are not legally binding. Most people ignore them.

So, I thought, wouldn't it be fun to have a script that would generate parodies of such footers. I have a TextExpander snippet that automagically appends a thoughtful quotation to the bottom of personal emails. Wouldn't it be fund to have a script appended nonsense corporate-speak footers, too? What footer would you include in the selection for that script?
