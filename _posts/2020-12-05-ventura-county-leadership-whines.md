Days after California's governor announced a new regional approach to slowing the spread of COVID-19 that will be triggered by a region's unused intensive care unit capacity dropping below 15%, the region to which Ventura County belongs saw its unused intensive care unit capacity drop below 15%.  This has caused county leadership to get a bit cranky.

It's not clear if it's members of the county Board of Supervisors or the Executive Officer, but county leadership is pushing back against Sacramento's new efforts to protect people by complaining that (1) Ventura County should not be placed in the Sounthern California region with other counties that compare poorly to ours, and (2) this new stay-at-home order is hurting businesses and the people they employ without sufficient justification in the form of data and science.
