Our county leadership, its Board of Supervisors and its Executive Officer, are not happy about California's new efforts to keep citizens safe during the global panedmic that it hitting our state hard.  One day after the governor announced a new regional approach to slowing the spread of COVID-19, one that will be triggered by a region's acailable intensive care unit capacity dropping below 15%, the county's region saw its unused intensive care unit capacity drop below 15%.  In a [message](https://vcportal.ventura.org/covid19/docs/2020-12-05_Stay_Home_Order_Triggered_in_Ventura_County_and_So_Cal_Region.pdf) sent out to the county on Saturday morning, our leadership gave voice to Republican talking points.

In the message, they told us they were pushing back against Sacramento's new efforts to protect people because (1) Ventura County should not be placed in the large Sounthern California region aklong side counties that compare poorly to ours, and (2) there's insufficient data to warrant restrictions on local businesses.  Other counties were saying the same thing.  

Let's assay these callous and selfish positions one at a time.

The first claim, of Ventura County's exceptionalism in Sacramento's regional framework, fell apart quickly before citizens received the email.  Sometime between when they drafted their message (Friday afternoon) and the time it was sent out, the county's own availble intensive care unit capacity was adjusted downward from 20+% to the triggering value of 15%.  So it turns out that we are dragging our neighbors into a stay-at-home state and not so much the other way around.  

The implied exceptionalism or their message should embarass county residents, too.  We are more like our neighboring counties than we are different.  Our county borders are pourus.  Think back to summer when LA County was closing its beaches.  My neighbors worried that LA residents would shift their coastal activites north to our beaches.  Similarly, when one county in the region exhausts its ICU capacity, other neighbors will be there to take our seriously ill.  In a pandemic, we need to loosen our grip on our hopes for local control of the county and create systems were we can work together against the virus.  Our county leadership has lost sight of this.

The second claim, that the state is not taking a scientific and data-driven approach to its public health measures rings especially hollow in our county.  This parroting Republican talking points could just as well be directed at county leadership themselves.  We have online COVID-19 dashboards and information pages, but there is no place to find information about results from contact tracing in the county.  In addition, the thin and repetitive county guidance on COVID-19 never mentions lessons learned from contact tracing.  The exception might be their vague claims that contact tracing data does not suggest the virus is spreading due to business activity in the county.

So let's look at that claim.  





In Ventura County, our leadership says that there is no data to suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through area businesses.  Leadership claims that data shows the virus is spreading through private, social gathering.  For this reason, they claim, the state-wide order is too coarse.  It penalizes businesses unfairly.

Let's take a scientific and data-driven approach to these claims.  The only data citizens in Ventura County have on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is that which has been shared with the Board of Supervisors in their public meetings.  The most recent is their meeting on [November 17th](https://ventura.granicus.com/DocumentViewer.php?file=ventura_58a3c87e35233d17ed380f3ab3956c34.pdf&view=1).  Agenda item 8, [``Receive a Report Regarding the Novel Coronavirus and Associated Disease known as COVID- 19''](http://bosagenda.countyofventura.org/sirepub/cache/2/nrt2vftlf1kkruemtjj4jhv1/161598712052020082726157.PDF).  These slides celebrate busines compliance without much evidence, and they claim the county takes a data-driven approach to public health measures.  They report COVID-19 cases are primarily from Long Term Care Facilities (4.9%), Grocery and Food Services (1.9%), School (0.6%), and Other (8.5%). They report that in the week ending on Halloween, 9.6% of cases were from large gatherings, and statewide cases were in healthcare services (50%), other (15%), restaurants (7%), schools (1%), and private homes (0.8%).

Look at these numbers and ask if they support county leadership's position that COVID-19 infections are NOT spreading through contact at retail businesses, restaurants, non-essential infrastructure.  They don't.

If there is better data out there, county Supervisors should share it.  Now.

Without data, citizens can only conclude that the county's approach to public health is motivated primarily by revenue, prioritizing the interests of business owners and what can only be called greedy capitalists in the county.  This certainloy isn't the case, but there's little evidence to the contrary.
