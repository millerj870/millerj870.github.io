There's been a couple threads on the [Traeger Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/93884743938/?fref=nf) about making salsa on a smoker. Since the number of posts on that group are so ... numerous ... it makes referencing my past posts on the topic hard to find. So I'm going to put my recipe here for easy future reference.

Here's the recipe for my batch. Thanks to Melanie Hardman Lilyquist for sharing a picture of the veggies she smoked and her post-smoking process.

    6 medium tomatos, halved  
    3 tomatillos, halved  
    1 orange pepper, quartered or smaller  
    1 yellow pepper, quartered or smaller  
    2 anaheim peppers, quartered (the long way)  
    2 jalape√±o peppers, quartered (the long way)  
    half a larger white onion, quartered  
    a bulb of garlic

Place veggies on a cookie sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt. On the Traeger, smoke for ninety minutes. Peel 4 or 5 cloves of garlic from the bulb to use. Set the rest aside for another use (like garlic butter). Then puree in a blender, adding 2 tsp. cumin, juice of one lime. Add salt and pepper to taste. Cool in a refrigerator before serving. The salsa you get will be sweet and fresh!

For a salsa that is less sweet and that has a bit more bite: substitute the two peppers (orange and yellow) for one red, and add a couple red tomatoes to make up for volume. Smoke as before. In addition to the 4-5 smoked garlic cloves, add 4-5 fresh garlic bulbs. Skip the lime and cumin. Instead, add 3 Tbsp of Worchester sauce. Puree. Chill. Enjoy.
