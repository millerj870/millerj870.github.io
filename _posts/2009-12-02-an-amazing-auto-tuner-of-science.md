If you are fond of science, and you haven't seen this yet, you should find five minutes of broadband access before the end of the day for this YouTube video posted by John Boswell (a.k.a. melodysheep) of <a href="http://www.symphonyofscience.com">http://www.symphonyofscience.com</a>. His goal in creating this piece (and other similar work, it seems) is, "to deliver scientific knowledge and philosophy in musical form."

In this video, Boswell brings a quartet of powerful popularizers of science together to get us thinking about the connectedness of things.

The earnestness and passion of deGrasse Tyson, Sagan, Nye, and Feynman survived the transmogrification of the audio and the slight video editing allows Boswell to sync their words with the music. The ideas behind this piece are BIG, and if a student of science (or mathematics) is allowed to sit back to listen and reflect on the message, I hope they'd find inspiration for their studies and their work. These ideas are one of the reasons I do what I do. I have hope that through science and mathematics we can find new inter-connections and new layers of our reality that can be used to improve the human condition.

Thanks to Ze Frank for tweeting this.
