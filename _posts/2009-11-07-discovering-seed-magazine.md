I just discovered this online magazine, <a href="http://www.seedmagazine.com/">SEED</a> (it has a print version, too) moments ago, and I haven't been able to rip myself away from the stories and images they publish. The mission of the magazine seems to be to explore the interface between science and culture. Their slideshows have my rapt attention (watch the one on the sculpture), and their articles seems to be quite well written.

There are also hooks to other science blogs on the net, too.

This is a source to pay attention to. Will it make science interesting and understandable and relevant to a lay audience? I think chances are good. Now, off to watch a SEED slideshow on <a href="http://seedmagazine.com/slideshow/mathematicians/">mathematicians</a><a href="http://seedmagazine.com/slideshow/mathematicians/"></a>.
