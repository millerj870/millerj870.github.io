title: The Feds Considering Putting An End to Subsidized Loan Program for Undergraduates
tags: higher-education

Is the Federal government really considering ending their program os subsidizing undergraduate loans? Sorry, but it <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/07/13/possible_threat_to_subsidized_student_loans_in_debt_talks">appears</a> to be true, according to an article this morning in Inside Higher Ed.

The article makes it sound like this cut will save the Federal government $40 billion dollars over, what I assume to be, 10 years. (Isn't that the window that the policy wonks are throwing around?) But, I ask, has anyone done the cost-benefit analysis on this change? Really, I want to know, and I'd like to see some references, Dear Reader.

Killing the subsidized loan program (even if it those funds are just moved over to need-based aid) will increase the real cost of education in America. This will decrease American economic competitiveness, which will decrease the long-term GDP. This type of analysis has been done. Take a look at Goldin and Katz's [The Race between Education and Technology](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674035305/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=theback0bc-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399377&creativeASIN=0674035305)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=theback0bc-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0674035305&camp=217145&creative=399377). They show a correlation (and strongly suggest a causative relationship) between education of Americans and the country's GDP.

If I hadn't had access to subsidized student loans, I would not have been able to go to a private college. No big deal, I'm sure. But I probably would have have been able to go to graduate school to get a Ph.D. in mathematics. (Being able to defer loan payments on my student loans made graduate school an attractive option for me.) What is your loan story? How would a change like this affect your students? Your kids?
