This week, I saw that a mathematician I'd never really heard of passed away.  He was famous enough, a probabilist and game theorist at UC Berkeley, and he was a member of the National Academy of Sciences.   This morning, I read an article about him at NYTimes.com, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/17/education/17blackwell.html">here</a>.

A quote at the end of the piece jumped out at me.

>Basically, I'm not interested in doing research and I never have been.  I'm interested in understanding, which is quite a different thing. And often to understand something you have to work it out yourself because no one else has done it.

A juxtaposition of great professional accomplishment and intense personal curiosity.
