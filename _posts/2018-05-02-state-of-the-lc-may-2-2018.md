Someday, I'll get the LC armored with bumpers, front and back, with a winch, recovery gear (hi-lift), and jerry cans.
Here's an [ih8mud thread](https://forum.ih8mud.com/threads/slee-front-bumper-vs-dissent-offroad-front-bumper-pros-and-cons.1035350/) on comparing two makes of bumper: the Slee and the DIssent.

The Slee has been around forever and is well loved. But as the 100-series line ages, more products get made for it, diversifying the offerings. What Dissent has to offer looks great, and I like what they write about their product.
