Jack, Naomi, and Tim arrived at their assigned Mayo Clinic surgical center on time.  This is how the day played out.  (The page will be updated periodically through the day.)

### 5:30am

Arrived.  Jack gets checked in, changes, gets and update from some staff, and is ready to go by 7:48am.

### 9:02am

The status display in the waiting room says Jackâ€™s procedure started at 9:02am.  (You can see the displays at the far end of the waiting room, pictured below.)
