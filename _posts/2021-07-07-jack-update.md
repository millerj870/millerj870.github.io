Jack, Naomi, and Tim arrived at their assigned Mayo Clinic surgical center on time.  This is how the day played out.  (The page will be updated periodically through the day.)

### 5:30am

Arrived.  Jack gets checked in, changes, gets an update from some staff, and is ready to go by 7:48am.

### 9:02am

The status display in the waiting room says Jack’s procedure started at 9:02am.  (You can see the displays at the far end of the waiting room, pictured below.)

### 11:04am

The surgery status display says, “The patient's procedure is starting to close.”  We’re not exactly sure what this means, but we assume that the main work is done.

Below is a picture of the status display that keeps Naomi and Tim updated.  The picture was taking shortly before 11am.  Click on the image to see Jack’s status highlighted.
