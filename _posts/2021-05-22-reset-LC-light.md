In early Februrary, I changed the rig's oil myself.  Bought a couple filters and gaskets along with a bunch of oil from Costco.  Set myself up for doing the next couple oil changes, too.

What I didn't know how to do was reset the 'Maintenance Required' light on the instrument panel.  Yesterday, I Googled the question and [found the answer](https://erwinsalarda.com/how-to-reset-maintenance-required-toyota-landcruiser/).

1. Put the key into the ignition, and turn the key to the ON position.
2. Set the odometer so it displays the current mileage.
3. Turn ignition OFF.
4. Hold the ODO/TRIP button while turning the key to the ON position.  Continue holding the button until the Maintenance Required light flashes and then goes out.
5. Turn the key to the OFF position.

It's that simple.
