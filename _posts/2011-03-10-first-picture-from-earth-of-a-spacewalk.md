Is this the first such picture, internationally? Or is it just the first such picture in America?</p>

Check out the pics at the [photographer's web page](http://legault.perso.sfr.fr/STS-133.html).  They are well annotated and exciting.

Taking ground-based photographs of satellites and space vehicles is a great project for young people interested in image processing and space.  In this case, the result is spectacular, but to get a photo of anything human-made (e.g., the ISS) would be exciting for young and old, alike.
