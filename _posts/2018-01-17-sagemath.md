I'm trying to learn to use SageMath as a computational tool my students can use in Calculus I and in Differential Geometry. The University does not appear to have computational resources that allow me to run a local SageMath Server, so I've used this page:

[https://wordpress.org/support/topic/sage-cell-embedding/](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/sage-cell-embedding/)

to figure out how to embed a SageMath Cell on my Wordpress homepage. This should help students a bit.
