This week, POTUS made hay with the fountain pen, signing several executive actions (orders and memoranda) that are making waves. If you want to keep score on the good/damage POTUS is doing, here’s the scorecard, as best as I can gather.  UPDATE:  Hours after posting, another EO on ethics was  created.  This post is updated to add that to the list, below.<!-- more -->

## [Executive orders](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/executive-orders)
