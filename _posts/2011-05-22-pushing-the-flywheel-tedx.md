TED. If you haven't heard of it, it's an acronym. Stands for "Technology, Entertainment, Design", but the "E" should really be "Education". The TED Conference brings together thinkers and doers from every discipline and sector. They share 18 minutes of insight from their life experience, and that slice is shared with the work through audio podcasts and video podcasts.

The TED Conference is a high-cost experience, but TED allows folks to franchise the experience through their <a href="http://www.ted.com/pages/about_tedx">TEDx program</a>.

My thought is to use the TEDx format as a stage for the high-quality work of Truman State University faculty and students.

Seems like a no-brainer approach to raising the profile of Truman, an underdog in higher education. The work of its faculty merit such exposure, and its students would certainly benefit from the cross-institutional exposure afforded by TED.
