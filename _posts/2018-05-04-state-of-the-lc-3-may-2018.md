Was walking around the truck today, and I saw at least one thing that should be added to the list. And I thought of a few others that should go onto it.

The tasks on my list (not in any particular order):

  1. get the timing belt and transfer case looked at

  2. address some upholstery problems (holes and small rips) to stop them from becoming a bigger problem,

  3. looking for salvage yards that might have compatible rigs with some plastic parts I need to replace (_e.g._, lid to fusebox under the hood, cover for compartment on passenger side of the 3rd row seating, tie-down ‘wingnut’ piece that covers a screw in the cargo area)

  4. working up the courage (and saving the money) for stereo upgrade - CarPlay compatibility, AUX in, BT for music; not sure if I want GPS, but it would save battery life on phone

  5. adding a simple aux battery to the rig; running some outlets for USB chargers

  6. converting some interior lights to LEDs (**Update:** kit ordered from [pfran](http://www.pfranleds.com))

  7. find some folks in my local area (Ventura County) who are interested in some day trips to trails in the Los Padres Wilderness or surrounding areas. I want to meet some people and strengthen some trail driving skills so I can overland camp with confidence with my rig

  8. tires are getting worn, so need to consider replacing them with something that balances smooth road ride, fuel efficiency, and effectiveness for overland camping (which isn’t the same as rock crawling)

  9. remove the airfoil and consider removing the roof rack

  10. remove the running boards and, perhaps, replace with sliders; without running boards and sliders, it sounds like people recommend mud flaps (here's a link to the part numbers on ih8mud: [OEM Front Mudflaps](https://forum.ih8mud.com/threads/oem-front-mudflaps-w-part-numbers.698687/))

  11. fix antenna mast, perhaps replacing it with a manual mast (?)

  12. add bolts to engine cover (two are missing, two are present)

  13. have headlights aimed, perhaps replacing the bulbs (instructions for aiming are [here](https://forum.ih8mud.com/threads/numbers-for-aiming-headlights.524503/#post-7016021))

  14. replace shocks (current shocks look original to truck) ... what should I replace them with?

  15. mount mobile 2m/70cm radio in dash or up front; large antenna mounted on rear bumper (?)
