Knocked one thing out on each of the three days this weekend: Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Descriptions after the jump.

Friday, I laid down some pinstripes driving around the nether reaches of CI Park. No pics. But I need to figure out how to reduce their long-term impact on the rig. Waxing? Buffing afterward? I'm willing to put up with some marking, but the wife doesn't like it.

Saturday, I drove down to Burbank's Ham Radio Outlet and picked up a goosneck mounting arm, a mounting bracket, a pigtail connector for a magmount, a magmount, and an antenna for running the Kenwood handheld transciever in the LC. Now I just need to figure out how to use the transciever. Hopefully the run to Shuteye will give me a way to test APRS.

I also ran to REI to get a sleeping pad and a National geographic map of Shuteye. After examining the camping location, I sent Randy Worth a FB Message asking for clarification on how to get to the camping site. If I'm driving up in convoy with others, I want to know where I need to go. This also made me think that I should download the relevant maps into my GPS.

Sunday, I realized where the license plate lights were, so I replaced those incandescent bulbs with LEDS. I also replaced the headlight bulbs. I ran to NAPA to get some bright bulbs (9005 and 9006) for main headlights and for high beams. Cost $108!!!! Repalcing the bulbs on the passenger side was easy. Nno components needed to be moved. Replacing the bulbs on the driver's side required removal of the grill, the headlight assembly, and the turn signal assembly. No one step was difficult. Together, there were just a little pain. I think I took things off and put them on three times before all was done.

Taking the grill off made me want to hit it with plasti-dip, but I couldn't decide mow much of the grill should be hit with the spray. Since I had more work that needed to be done that evening, I put this one off for another time.

The tasks on my list (not in any particular order):

  1. address some upholstery problems (holes and small rips) to stop them from becoming a bigger problem,

  2. looking for salvage yards that might have compatible rigs with some plastic parts I need to replace (_e.g._, <strike>lid to fusebox under the hood</strike>, cover for compartment on passenger side of the 3rd row seating, tie-down ‘wingnut’ piece that covers a screw in the cargo area)

  3. adding a simple aux battery to the rig; running some outlets for USB chargers

  4. tires are getting worn, so need to consider replacing them with something that balances smooth road ride, fuel efficiency, and effectiveness for overland camping (which isn’t the same as rock crawling)

  5. <strike> remove the airfoil and</strike> consider removing the roof rack

  6. mount mobile 2m/70cm radio in dash or up front; large antenna mounted on rear bumper (?)

  7. add bolts to engine cover (two are missing, two are present) - requires a bracket that's missing

  8. single sleeping platform in rear

  9. plati-dip grill to black

  10. repair A/C leak that drips onto the feet of the LC passenger (first row)

  11. repair broken speakers - need to identify those that don't work, order replacements (mud threads; infinity)

  12. obtain fire extinguisher(s) for rig

COMPLETED

  1. have headlights aimed, perhaps replacing the bulbs (instructions for aiming are [here][11])

  2. add gooseneck rail mount system for handheld transceiver in cockpit

  3. remove the running boards and, perhaps, replace with sliders; without running boards and sliders, it sounds like people recommend mud flaps (here’s a link to the part numbers on ih8mud: [OEM Front Mudflaps][10])

  4. removed air deflector

  5. find some folks in my local area (Ventura County) who are interested in some day trips to trails in the Los Padres Wilderness or surrounding areas. I want to meet some people and strengthen some trail driving skills so I can overland camp with confidence with my rig

  6. converting some interior lights to LEDs (Update: kit ordered from [pfran][9])

  7. <strike>working up the courage (and saving the money) for stereo upgrade - CarPlay compatibility, AUX in, BT for music; not sure if I want GPS, but it would save battery life on phone</strike> **Update**: used @SerialHobbyist’s approach to ‘upgrading’ the stereo

  8. post-purchase shop maintenance: replaced the timing belt and transfer case looked at (someday, have from at [RPM Garage][8] in Monrovia take a look at the rig)

  9. replace shocks (current shocks look original to truck) - Kyb EXCEED-D recommended by S&M Auto

  10. customize wiring to the homelink system in the top console so it only activiates as an accessory as opposed to being 'always on'

  11. NOT BROKEN, just anemic: fix antenna mast, perhaps replacing it with a manual mast (?)
