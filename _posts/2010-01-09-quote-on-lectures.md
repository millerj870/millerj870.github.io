"The definition of a lecture has become the process in which the notes of the teacher go to the notes of the student without going through the brains of either." -- Donald Tapscott in <a href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/tapscott09/tapscott09_index.html">"The Impending Demise of the University"</a>

Tapscott's essay is a must read for everyone.
