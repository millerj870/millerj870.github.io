title: Student Uses LaTeX to write classnotes
tags: mathematics writing coding
---

Here's a remarkable blog post written by a mathematics student in Belgium who uses LaTeX to take notes in his mathematics classes.  His criterion:  he needs to be able to record as fast as or faster than the professor writes, he doesn't want to have to edit after the class, and something else.

The blog post details his setup on the editor Vim and in a Linux environment.  I'm sure that it could be copied in other (more modern) editors and in OS X.

I discovered this blog post in this Tweet.  The comments are worth reading, as they address how to do something similar in other environments.
