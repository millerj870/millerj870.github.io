There was an unsuccessful coup the other day.  We can't be smug about its failure.  Scholars say successful coups are almost always preceded by an unsuccessful coup or two.  So we need to be vigilant.  We need to root out the bad actors and use our judicial system to hold them accountable.

This document aims to start a list of people who appear in media as being identified by authorities or armchair sleuths as being in the coup vanguard.  This list will be updated as more is known about the actors.  In time, this list (if maintained) might be a place that will help others piece together the stories of those who were enthralled by Trump's lies.

This post begins with this article in the Washington Post that documents some of the first arrests:  [``Guns, Brass Knuckles, Homemade Napalm: Read Some of the Documents From Arrests After the Capitol Riot"](https://www.washingtonian.com/2021/01/11/guns-brass-knuckles-homemade-napalm-read-some-of-the-documents-from-arrests-after-the-capitol-riot/).

Here is a link to a project started George Washington University *Program on Extremism* where they are tracking
* the number of people charged,
* the charges filed against those arrested, and
* documents from the court system[^1] for each individual.

Here's the link the program's [https://extremism.gwu.edu/Capitol-Hill-Cases](https://extremism.gwu.edu/Capitol-Hill-Cases) page.

It also looks like the US Department of Justice has a page for [Investigations Regarding Violence At The Capitol](https://www.justice.gov/opa/investigations-regarding-violence-capitol).  It lists complaints and has links to charging documents and supporting documents.

[^1]: This year, American's have been shown that white supremacy and white nationalism runs deep in our society and systems, so we need to be aware of systemic 'implicit bias' (if we can call it that) and work to make sure that our courts dispense justice fairly.  This won't be easy.


## Individual Participants ##

Here is an incomplete list of participants in the coup.  Links above will be more complete and authoritative.  Individuals below are listed in rough alphabetical order.  When easy, their state of origin is also listed.  After each name is at least one link to information about the individual(s) that has appeared in the popular (online) news media or social media.
