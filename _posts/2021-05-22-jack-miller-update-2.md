Jack continues to improve.  He seems to have more energy every day, seems fatiguied less often, and is taking more exercise.  In a meeting with the kidney doctor *du jour*, we learned that the kidney team no longer believes the kidneys were a primary source of the problem that hospitalized Jack.  "They were innocent bystanders," the doctors said.  They suffered an acute injury from the contrast dyes and the antibiotics.  Now they are getting better.  Jack's creatinine numbers continue to decrease, and the doc said this shows him and his colleagues that should just let the kidneys recover on their own.  No need for biopsy.  No need for assistive dialysis.

It gets better.  This was the firt meeting where a doctor mentioned anything about an end to his treatment at St. John's.  "A few days more" is what he (probably said).  That was exciting for all of us to hear.

Meanwhile, the neurologists and the oncologists appear to be running the Jack show, and we haven't heard from them recenly.  We know they are reaching out to Mayo for a referral.  We don't exactly know what this means.  Does it mean they are reviewing the case?  Does it mean they are considering taking Jack on as a patient?  Hopefully, we'll hear, soon.
