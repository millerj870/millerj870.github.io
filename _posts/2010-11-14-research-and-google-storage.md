Google has given me permission to use their Google Storage service. It's also given me permission to use the Google Predication API. I'm thinking of using this in service of some research projects I've conducted with colleagues and undergraduate collaborators. The dataset aren't huge, but sharing them between institutions has been a PITA. I wonder if anybody else has use Google Storage to collaborate on small-scale academic research projects in the life sciences.
