Insider HigherEd <a href="http://bit.ly/kOcDhl" target="_blank">reports</a> this morning on an interesting reversal on the 2006 Affirmative Action ruling which made broadening participation in higher education (and STEM) more difficult. If this reversal holds, it will be a Big Thing.

The original voter ban changed the way higher education talked about and measured diversity. Some of those changes were healthy, some were fake. With this impending change, I hope higher education can keep the best practices it developed for diversifying colleges and Universities.
