When in a National Park, I like to be able to communicate with Park rangers over my radio.  Because the FCC says that I’m not authorized to transmit on their frequencies (except in the case of an emergency)[^1], this usually means I’m listening in.  But if I have their frequencies programmed into my radio, I can reach out to them should an emergency arise!

NPS frequencies can be found [here](https://www.radioreference.com/apps/db/?inputs=1&aid=4513#cats) on this RadioReference.com site.
