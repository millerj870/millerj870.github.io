>Great advice on sending sensitive stuff via [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com/) >. And pretty close to what I do. With this handful of paranoid additions >involving chaos and automation:
>
>**Parent Folder**. in your "`~/Dropbox/Public`" folder, create a new folder >with a sensible name like, "`seekritstuff`"
>
>**James Bond Naming**. Keep a sane name for the uncompressed source doc you're >sending (say, "`2010_income.txt`"), but _rename the zipped version_ of that >file with a random name, _e.g._, something like, "`I8-H~*gY{4%u.zip`"

>TIP: [1password](http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password) can generate >a "password"-style string that makes a swell file name

>Maybe an unnecessary step. But it does makes the file name way harder to just _>guess_

>**Hazel help**. _Most Important_. Create a [Hazel](http://www.macupdate.com/>info.php/id/22694/hazel) rule for "`~/Dropbox/Public/seekritstuff`" that >automatically moves any file it contains to a local/non-Dropbox folder on your >Mac _n_ days or hours after "Date Added".  Mine's set to 36 hours, but your >setting can be whatever suits you and your recipients

>**Two-steppin'**. Yes, send your recipient _the link to that zipped file_ (NOT >the actual file)--but do so in a separate and obscure-looking email that makes >no reference to either previous emails _or_ the link's contents.

>Like anything that touches an open network--and most especially anything that touches _email_--it's a solution that's far from perfect. But, to my mind, it feels a little safer than crap like sending plaintext via email.

>Seriously. My mind is boggled by how many people throw sensitive stuff around in email to complete strangers--the equivalent of writing a password on a postcard. Then pinning it to the corkboard in the laundromat. _Insane_.
