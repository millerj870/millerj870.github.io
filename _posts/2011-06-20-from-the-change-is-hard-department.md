Just caught <a href="http://bit.ly/lb8TFh">"Why Change Is So Hard: Self-Control Is Exhaustible"</a> by Dan Heath. It's a year old, but it's new to me. Too bad it doesn't have any references. <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/files/attachments/584/baumeisteretal1998.pdf">This</a> looks like a primary paper on the experiment Heath describes.
