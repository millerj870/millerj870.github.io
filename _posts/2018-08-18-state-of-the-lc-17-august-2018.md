It's been a while since I updated this saga.  Let me think.  What I have I done since I last reported?  There are a couple things I added to my task list and list of accomplishments.

The tasks on my list (not in any particular order):

  1. address some upholstery problems (holes and small rips) to stop them from becoming a bigger problem,
  2. looking for salvage yards that might have compatible rigs with some plastic parts I need to replace (_e.g._, lid to fusebox under the hood, cover for compartment on passenger side of the 3rd row seating, tie-down ‘wingnut’ piece that covers a screw in the cargo area)
  3. adding a simple aux battery to the rig; running some outlets for USB chargers
  4. tires are getting worn, so need to consider replacing them with something that balances smooth road ride, fuel efficiency, and effectiveness for overland camping (which isn’t the same as rock crawling).  Options mentioned on ih8mud:
    1. BF Goodrich All Terrain KO2
    2. BFG KO2s at Costco
    3. "Your stock size tire is 275/60/18. You can easily fit a 275/65/18 (the sidewall would be a little taller than your current tire and provide a little more cushion once aired down). You can fit a 285/65/18 BFG KO2 or a 275/70/18 as well. The road ride will actually suffer a little bit from a larger/heavier tire with a harder compound. It's not life changing, but your truck will feel a little different and your gas mileage mile suffer slightly as well. Your speedometer will be just slightly off after installing a larger tire too. It's important to purchase 5 tires and not 4. You absolutely need a matching spare."  

    4. 285/75/16 Toyo R/T (might be too big to mount underneath - would touch the rear muffler)
  5. mount mobile 2m/70cm radio in dash or up front; large antenna mounted on rear bumper (?)
  6. add bolts to engine cover (two are missing, two are present) - requires a bracket that’s missing
  7. single sleeping platform in rear
  8. plati-dip grill to black  

  9. repair broken speakers - need to identify those that don’t work, order replacements (mud threads; infinity)
  10. roof rack ([Bowfin Cruisers](https://www.bowfincruisers.com/products/100-series-roof-rack)?)
  11. awning  

  12. armor up:
    1. first, sliders ([Trail Tailor](http://trail-tailor.com/store/p43/100_Series_Sliders.html)?  [White Knuckle](https://white-knuckleoffroad.com/product/toyota-100-series-land-cruiser-lexus-lx470-rock-sliders/)?)
    2. second, rear bumper (Dissent Off-Road?)
    3. third, front bumper (Dissent Off-Road, too?  Addicted Off-Road?)
  13. [portable compressor](https://www.amazon.com/Viair-00088-88P-Portable-Compressor/dp/B005ASY23I/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1534568292&sr=8-1-fkmr0&keywords=VAIAR+88P+compressor) for airing up

COMPLETED

  1. have headlights aimed, perhaps replacing the bulbs (instructions for aiming are [here][11])
  2. add gooseneck rail mount system for handheld transceiver in cockpit
  3. remove the running boards and, perhaps, replace with sliders; without running boards and sliders, it sounds like people recommend mud flaps (here’s a link to the part numbers on ih8mud: [OEM Front Mudflaps][10])
  4. removed air deflector
  5. find some folks in my local area (Ventura County) who are interested in some day trips to trails in the Los Padres Wilderness or surrounding areas. I want to meet some people and strengthen some trail driving skills so I can overland camp with confidence with my rig
  6. converting some interior lights to LEDs (Update: kit ordered from [pfran][9])
  7. working up the courage (and saving the money) for stereo upgrade - CarPlay compatibility, AUX in, BT for music; not sure if I want GPS, but it would save battery life on phone **Update**: used @SerialHobbyist’s approach to ‘upgrading’ the stereo. **Update #2:**  this 'upgrade' kinda sux.
  8. post-purchase shop maintenance: replaced the timing belt and transfer case looked at (someday, have from at [RPM Garage][8] in Monrovia take a look at the rig)
  9. replace shocks (current shocks look original to truck) - Kyb EXCEED-D recommended by S&M Auto
  10. obtained small fire extinguisher(s) for rig; one of the 'cans' that sits in my tool box in the back
  11. customize wiring to the homelink system in the top console so it only activiates as an accessory as opposed to being ‘always on’
  12. NOT BROKEN, just anemic: fix antenna mast, perhaps replacing it with a manual mast (?)
  13. added a goose-neck stand that bolts to passenger-side front seat rails and holds my cell phone or my Ham radio; have a mag-mount antenna for the ham radio that I put out when using
  14. removed air deflector and put screws into exposed holes.  NOTE:  screws quickly started to rust; need to find stainless
  15. added J-hooks to factor roof rack for kayak
  16. repaired water leak that drips onto the feet of the LC passenger (first row) when A/C is running; used 3M strip caulk (need to check the name) to replace the gasket that was failing.  Noted a bunch of gunk in the air filter space, but could only get some out.  Wife was impressed that I did this myself.
