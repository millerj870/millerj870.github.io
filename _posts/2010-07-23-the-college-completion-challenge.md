title: The College Completion Challenge

There's an article in the NYTimes on-line, here <a href="http://nyti.ms/97qkLM">http://nyti.ms/97qkLM</a>, on depressed college completion rates threatening American economic competitiveness. (Have you heard that theme somewhere else?) The article is a bit dry, has some data, talks about some people who are 'doing something', and has at least one link to an external report. 

The article made me think of the much more inspiring keynote address by Freeman Hrabowski to practitioners gathered at last year's annual conference of the National Institute for the Study of Transfer Students. I wrote about it a bit, here <a href="http://bit.ly/du3zPx">http://bit.ly/du3zPx</a>. He gives his audience a much more interesting an engaging look at the same problem.
