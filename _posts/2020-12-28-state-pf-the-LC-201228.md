The rainy season is here, and I don't know why I didn't prepare for it correctly.

When I went out to the rig this morning, my locks weren't obeying my remote.  Puzzle, I unlocked the door with the key, expecting an alarm.  Nothing.  Then I had the 'oh sh*t' moment when I realized the rain might be screwing with my electrics, again.

I put my key in the ignition and turned it to the 'on' position.  Nothing.  Except a buzz coming from under the hood.  Inspecting, I found this.

I've hooked up my battery charger.  It's not going well.

Any thoughts on what's going wrong?

(The wife reported that our Suburu has a rough start this morning, too, but I think that's just a coincidence.)

### Follow-up 1 ###

I went back out to the rig to power it up and listen to the relay buzzing, and I noticed that the cadence of the relay matched the brightness cadence of the 'security' LED on the dash.

### Follow-up 2 ###

I use a [Pro-Logix](https://cloreautomotive.com/product/pl2320/) battery charger that has too many setting, so I'm not confident in how I should use it.  I discovered while tweaking the settings that changing the current (between 2A and 10A and 20A) caused thehorn (I think) to click at different rates.  Later, the horn was silent at 2A but would honk at 10A and 20A.  Strange.

### Follow-up 3 ###

Question:
>tyring to jump battery horn blows and lights flash

Answer:
> It's probably your alarm system that's going off. When the battery died, the car's alarm system assumed that someone is tampering with the battery or had disconnected it in order to break into the car. Here's what you can do hook up the jumper cables. The horn will start to blow. As soon as it does, using the key fob, lock and then unlock the doors or basically whatever you usually do to shut off your alarm. once you've disabled the alarm go ahead and try to start up.

Sure enough, this explained the honking I described in Follow-up 1 (above), and maybe the relay clicking that I heard when I first powered on the rig.  Now my fingers are crossed that the battery charger will work.

Note: when I got the security system to shut up, I noticed that the parking lights were on.  This was a symptom of the problem I was having last year and should have fixed.  Looks like I need to crawl in the cab with my orthroscopic camera and allow it to earn its keep.
