Just discovered this place, the <a href="http://momath.org/">Museum of Mathematics</a>, via <a href="http://www.makezine.com/">Make Magazine</a>. I don't know much about it, and the web page doesn't have much detailed information on its exhibits, but from what I can see it seems pretty cool. <p /> The Museum of Mathematics is contributing a "Math Monday" entry to the Make Magazine <a href="http://blog.makezine.com/">blog</a> that looks like its worth a follow, too.
