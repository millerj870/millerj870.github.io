President Obama says that he is putting Colleges and Universities on notice.   If they don't stop tuition from increasing, they will watch their public funding decrease.   Funny.   I think most pubic colleges and Universities are increasing their tuition BECAUSE public funding is being cut by state lawmakers.   Maybe I'm missing some Federal system of higher education?!
