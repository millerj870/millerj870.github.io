Found this nice little cartoony introduction to Ada Lovelace here 

<a href="http://www.brainpop.com/math/numbersandoperations/adalovelace/">http://www.brainpop.com/math/numbersandoperations/adalovelace/</a>

Take a few minutes to watch it. And expolre the site a bit, too. Looks like a nice resource for opening peoples' eyes to math, science, and computation.
