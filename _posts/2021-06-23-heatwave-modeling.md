Climate change is making weather prediction a bit more complicated these days, and climate scientists are having a hard time keeping up.  Last week, a climate scientist reported that an important weather prediction model was giving absurd results for West Coast weather that was ten days away.

<!-- 6/18, report of 'absurd' predicted temps 10 days out -->

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Posting as heads-up to weather modeling world (not as a realistic prediction of future conditions): the (new) GFS has occasionally been spitting out completely absurd surface temperatures for CA&#39;s Central Valley. 18z run today shows 128-130F. Anyone know what&#39;s up? <a href="https://t.co/qmhP3eeGuF">pic.twitter.com/qmhP3eeGuF</a></p>&mdash; Daniel Swain (@Weather_West) <a href="https://twitter.com/Weather_West/status/1406022372109418497?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 18, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Notable here is a modeling professional describing model output as "not realistic" and "completely absurd".  This means that model was doing something unexpected and that its output was unbelievable.

Granted, a 10-day forecast is less reliable than a 10-hour forecast.  Mathematical models are better at accurately predicting events that are near their input data.  In the case of temporal weather forecasts, this means the near-future predications are more accurate than far-future predictions.  And certainly the modeler here knows that.  And yet he describes the model output as "completely absurd" and puts out a call for help in his efforts to identify the source of the problem.

Three days later, he's made little progress to his goal of finding a problem.

<!-- 3 days later, other models are doing it, too -->

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Seems as if the ECMWF is now doing something similar. Either both models share some kind of similar surface scheme bias/error that involves sporadic positive/self-reinforcing surface temp feedback during extreme events (still by far most likely), or...hmm. <a href="https://t.co/exwvekuPSW">https://t.co/exwvekuPSW</a></p>&mdash; Daniel Swain (@Weather_West) <a href="https://twitter.com/Weather_West/status/1406981617747324929?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 21, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This tweet is a bit hard to parse.  My takeaway is this:  two different models are giving the same prediction (now a seven-day farecast).  If these two models are built differently, then this decreases the likelihood that the model output is the result of some "error" or "mistake".  It is evidence supporting the idea the original forecast was not a mistake.

Two days later, the professional are shrugging their shoulders and trusting the model, whose predictions are record breaking but not quite as extreme.

Aven the National Weather Service is rolling with it, now.

Looks like we're in for a hot one!
