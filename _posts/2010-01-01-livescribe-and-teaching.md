Found a <a href="http://www.livescribe.com/">LiveScribe Pulse</a> in my Xmas stocking. Now the question is, "How do I use this to enhance the things that I do?" Better yet, how can I leverage this technology in the cause of #hackedu and <a href="http://www.thencat.org/">course redesign</a>.

Here is one answer to this question: PenCasts.

<a href="http://math247.pbworks.com/How-to-Embed-Pencasts">Here</a> is a site on this topic.

If anyone has pointers on (1) how to use this in an effective way, or (2) how this technology is migrating toward being open sourced or open;y accessible, I'd appreciate hearing from you in the comments.
