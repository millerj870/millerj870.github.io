Two thoughts have come to my when I’ve taken time to reflect on what’s happening around me.

First, I endorse the safety-pin movement. It seems like it sets the right tone and conveys a positive message.

Second, those who have concerns about the President-elect should remind themselves and others to think critically about what is happening around us by wearing black on the first Tuesday after the first Monday of each month. (Such a Tuesday is in November is always the day of the general election for federal public officials.)

Alternatively, someone should design a thoughtful arm band (_e.g._, black cloth with a design) that will remind us to be vigilant. A person can wear an arm band at any time and with any outfit.
