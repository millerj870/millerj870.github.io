This post is about companies that are reacting to America's attempted coup on January 6th by pausing political donations.  I started trying to collect tweets that announced these changes until I noticed all the tweets were from @JuddLegum who, with @TesnimZekeria, is working to document the companies that do (and those that don't) make such a change.  Benjay Renton (@bhrenton) is also collecting this data and sharing it in one place.

## Judd Legum ##

Legum sent inquiries to a long list of companies who are known to make political donations to candidates and elected officials.  He is publishing a pricey political newsletter that conveys what he learns, but he's also posting it here, ["Major corporations say they will stop donating to members of Congress who tried to overturn the election"](https://popular.info/p/three-major-corporations-say-they).  It appears he's updating this page with more companies and he learns of them.

He's also maintaining a list of companies who have not reponded to his inquiries.  You can find that list on Twitter, here:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here is the full list of the 65 companies that have not responded<br><br>All of these companies donated to one or more of the 8 Senators who objected during the 2020 cycle<br><br>The Senators followed through with their objection AFTER the riot. <br><br>Sign up for updates: <a href="https://t.co/TfpCItdVSo">https://t.co/TfpCItdVSo</a> <a href="https://t.co/7SYKzJNMPQ">pic.twitter.com/7SYKzJNMPQ</a></p>&mdash; Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) <a href="https://twitter.com/JuddLegum/status/1349454295884836871?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 13, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Benjamin Renton ##

This list is also being tracked and shared by @bhrenton (Benjy Renton) who is putting it into a [tableau database](https://public.tableau.com/profile/benjamin.renton#!/vizhome/WhiteHouseResignationTracker/Dashboard1) and displaying it.  I hope this means he will track it through the year.

## Forbes ##

*Forbes, Inc.* made a related announcement. Editor Randall Lane warns in an [editorial](https://www.forbes.com/sites/randalllane/2021/01/07/a-truth-reckoning-why-were-holding-those-who-lied-for-trump-accountable/?sh=1b39c7e55710) that Forbes is monitoring Trump pfficials to see where they land at the end of Trump's presidency.  Noting that Trump's administration was based on lies from start to end, he writes to those companies that “Forbes will assume that everything your company or firm talks about is a lie."
