title: Conan Expresses the 'Failure' Meme
tags: failure

Either it's one of those mid-life things for me or there's a meme going around about embracing 'failure' and the growth that comes from 'making mistakes'. It looks like Conan O'Brien gave voice to this in his <a href="http://bit.ly/jM9NLv">commencement speech</a> at Dartmouth this Spring. </p><

> In 2000—in 2000—I told graduates to not be afraid to fail, and I still believe that. But today I tell you that whether you fear it or not, disappointment will come. The beauty is that through disappointment you can gain clarity, and with clarity comes conviction and true originality.

It's worth the read. it's also been YouTubed.
