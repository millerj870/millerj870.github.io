In my quest for podcasts that would be of interest to STEM students, I've run across this fourteen minute beauty. Simon Singh in his BBC program _Another Five Numbers_ talks about the mathematical theory of games in a very understandable and pleasant fashion. In this program we learn about zero-sum games, John Nash and his Nash equilibrium, John von Neumann, and how this type of mathematics is used in finance.

Take a listen.
