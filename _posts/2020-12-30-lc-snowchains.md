Last year, when the tread on the tires was wearing thin, I upgraded the rig to 32s.  Specifically, I purchased five Michelen Defender LTX M/S 275/65R18 (32 inch) tires.  The rig looks good!

This week, the family wanted to see snow.  (We didn't make our annual holiday trip to Minnesota and Chicagoland, and this would be one way to scratch an itch for cold.)  This meant being prepared to put on chains.

I'd purchased chains for the previous stock tires, but I didn't know if they'd fit.  THe packaging for the chains said they'd fit up to 275/65/17 tires.  Mine are slightly larger.

There was only one way to see if they'd fit.

It was close, but I feel comfortable with how they attach.
