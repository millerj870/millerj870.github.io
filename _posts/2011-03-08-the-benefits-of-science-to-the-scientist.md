title: The Benefits of Science to the Scientist

Nice thoughtful and short essay on the value of studying (and doing) science to the scientist student.

>You become a different person with scientific training, and we do science because we value that kind of person.
Science is not only bridge-building (usefulness and technology driven) and knowledge-building (adding to the pile
of facts we know about reality) it is also people, character, and citizen-building.

Surf over to ["So, whatâ€™s science good for?"](http://bit.ly/fnKXeN)on the [Rationally Speaking](http://bit.ly/ejlLyD) blog and judge for yourself.
