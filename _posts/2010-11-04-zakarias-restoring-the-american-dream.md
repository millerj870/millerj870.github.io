This weekend, while I was playing hookey from Church, I stumbled upon this program on Fareed Zakaria's GPS, on CNN. It was a program titled "Restoring the American Dream" and it talks about what America needs to do get back on track to be the world's greatest economic powerhouse.

I liked this program so much I made the students in my Senior Seminar (for mathematics majors) sit through it. I hope it gave them a sense for the ideas in Zakaria's <i>The Post-American World</i> and Thomas Friedman's <i>The World is Flat</i>. it also suggested that Seth Godin's <i>Linchpin</i> could be useful for those who are about to graduate from college.
