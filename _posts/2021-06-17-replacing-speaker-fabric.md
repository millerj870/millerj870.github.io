[Refoaming my speakers](URL) was a perfect time for me to replace the cloth covers on my speaker grills.

After searching for a local source for speaker cloth turned up nothing, I ordered some [grey speaker cloth](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0874KZ3JH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) from Amazon.  When I ordered, I didn't know how the shade would compare to the faculty cloth.

While waiting for that cloth to arrive, I removed all the speaker grills from the door and side panels, detached the speaker fabric, and washed the grills with soap and water.  I also went to the local Michaels to buy some fabric-to-plastic adhesive; my choices were a Loctite and an E6000 adhesive, in case I ran out of the former.

When the cloth arrived, I set about to replace the cloth covers, but I noticed that the shades of grey were very different.

Here's how the speaker grills would end up looking later in the process.

To get them there, I did the following:

1. roughly cut the speaker coverign fabic from so that it would fit over the grill and need to be trimmed back,
2. applied adhesive[^2] to the edges of the grill (both sides) and spread the adhesive out with a small brush,
3. gently and slightly stretched the fabric over the grill, folding it over the edges of the grill and holding it there with small binder clips.

Here is a picture of the last step.

This all seemed to work well.[^1]  There may be a time where I want speaker sloth that's a better match to my LC's interior.  That's OK.  For now, my speakers look better, and I know how to change the clother covering.

[^1]:  If I did this again, I'd use something to minimize the indent that the binder clips would make in th e outward-facing side of the speaker grill.  Maybe I'd use a slice of parchment paper layered with a slice of cardboard.

[^2]:  A quick search of the internet suggested that Loctite and E6000 had fabric-to-plastic adhesives that would work well for this project.  I got a quantity of each from the local Michaels shoppe.
