## Public Officials who need to hear my voice

The following are some public officials who are going to hear my thoughts on the first week of POTUS’s term. I’ll call their phone lines, first. And I may mail a letter, knowing that letters will be delayed significantly for security concerns.

UPDATED 1/29/2017 with information on using the Capitol switchboard to contact your Congressional representatives.

### Congressional Leadership

The leaders in Congress should be taking a stand and either pushing back on the POTUS actions or defending their correctness. Right now, we’re hearing nothing from the GOP. Their colleagues from the other side of the aisle needs to convince them that remaining silent in the face of a potential demagogue will cost them (and America) in the future.

Paul Ryan, Speaker of the House 1233 Longworth House Office Building Washington, DC 20515 Phones: 202–225–0600, 202–225–3031

Mitch McConnell, House Majority Leader 317 Russell Senate Office Building Washington, DC 20515 Phone: 202–224–2541

Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader 332 Hart Senate Office Building Washington, DC 20515 Phone: 202–224–6542

Dianne Feinstein, CA Senator 331 Hart Senate Office Building Washington, DC 20515 Phone: 202–224–3841

Kamala Harris, CA Senator B40B Dirksen Senate Office Building Washington, DC 20515 Phone: 202–224–3553

Julia Browlney, CA Representative for District XXX 1019 Longworth House Office Building Washington, DC 20515 Phone: 202–225–5811

Ed Royce, CA Representative for District 39th and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman 2310 Rayburn House Office Building Washington, DC 20515 Brea Phone: 714–255–0101 LA Phone: 626–964–5234 DC Phone: 202–225–4111

Note: Royce has actually defended the ban on immigration. He needs to be schooled in American history.

If you are reading this and you don't live in my Congressional district, you can call the Capitol switchboard at 202-224-3121. Switchboard operators will connect you with the Senator or Representative you want to talk with. See [this page](http://civilrights.org/action_center/resources/calling-congress.html) for advice on how to talk with a member of Congress.

### The White House

Everyone should let the White House know how they feel, too. They do have a comment line.

White House Comment Line: 202–456–1111

Unforunately, recent accounts say the comment line is off-line. Due to the volume of calls? For political reasons? Maybe the switchboard operators resigned with State Department career leadership. Fortunately, some code monkeys came up with a tool that will allow you to call one of the Trump properties (ther other “white houses”) to express your comment. Go to this web page, and read the instructions.
