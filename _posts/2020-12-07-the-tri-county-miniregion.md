Ventura County tallys COVID-19 testing results on the weekend, but it doesn't report any new numbers on Saturdays or Sundays.  This means that our Monday reports have worryingly high numbers.  Until recently, reminding myself that the number covered three days calmed me.  This didn't work today.

Today's report was 1,289 new cases since Friday.  The closest they get to implementing public health policy independent of the state is by saying, "Please continue to wear a mask, social distance, wash hands frequently and avoid gatherings to help slow the spread of COVID-19."

The email also included text from this [message](https://vcportal.ventura.org/CEO/VCNC/2020-12-07_PressRelease_SoCalRegionStayAtHomeOrders.pdf):

>>    The County of Ventura, Santa Barbara County and San Luis Obispo County will be seeking State approval to separate from the large Southern California Region under the Stateâ€™s Stay Home Order to create a smaller tri-county Central Coast Region. The Counties will be submitting a unified request for the smaller regional approach if the tri-county ICU capacity exceeds 15% in the next three weeks. At that time the Counties will request to be assessed based on the tri-county ICU capacity and not the Southern California Regional ICU capacity.

This effort is consistent with the state-wide Republican talking points pushing back against the Governor's public health efforts under the flag of 'local control' and a call for data that supports the governor's decisions.

In the same spirit, we ask Mike Powers, our county's Executive Officer, for the data that supports the formation of a tri-county Central Coast region within the governor's COVID-19 framework.  What are the benefits to Ventura County and the state?  What are the costs to both?  Please share the data.  Public policy works better if citizens understand and trust it.
