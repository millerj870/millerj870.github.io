A group calling itself 'Teachers in Space' is offering a cool looking workshop for those who teach science, technology, engineering, or math at the high-school level.

>Participating teachers will fly in a glider and learn to pilot a flight simulator for the Lynx suborbital spacecraft now under development by XCOR Aerospace.   

See [[here]](http://bit.ly/e55Rzo) for more info and a link to the application. Encourage your favorite HS teacher to apply to participate!
