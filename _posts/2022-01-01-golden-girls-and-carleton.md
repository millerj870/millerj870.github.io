Betty White passed away yesterday.  Well-wishers flooded twitter with messages mourning her passing and celebrating her life.  One tweet from @jxeker shared a clip from *The Golden Girls* where Rose Nyland (betty White's character) is telling a story from her past to help her friends resolve a problem.  The clip shows her actor colleagues breaking in the face of Ms. White's comic chops.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I was just thinking: <a href="https://t.co/0efirriS0a">pic.twitter.com/0efirriS0a</a></p>&mdash; Lena Jessica ðŸ˜· (@lenajessica) <a href="https://twitter.com/lenajessica/status/1477021695210885124?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 31, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

After enjoying the clip, I saw the above reply from @lenajessica and had to reply with this (please excuse the typo):

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">And boy is there a story behind THAT story! RIP Betty White, an blessing to all Oles everywhere.</p>&mdash; Jason &quot;Je Suis Antifa&quot; Miller (@jasonemiller) <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonemiller/status/1477039110082613251?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 31, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Because my reply has gotten a few likes (why, I don't know), I thought I'd share the unsubstantiated story that's behind my tweet.

## Two Colleges
By way of background, The Golden Girls was in production from 1985 until 1992.[^1]  I'm an alum ('93) of Saint Olaf College in Northfield, MN.  I knew of the Golden Girls program, and I could recognize the four lead actors, but I didn't know much about the Golden Girls universe.  Specifically, I did not know about the silly way our college was written into the show[^3] until Betty White [visited Northfield](https://wp.stolaf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/St.-Olaf-Magazine-Fall-2012-The-Golden-Girl.pdf) in 1992.

Northfield spans the Canon River, with St. Olaf on a hill to the West and Carleton College, another private liberal arts college, adjacent to downtown to the East.  [St. Olaf College](https://wp.stolaf.edu) is a college of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America, and it takes its Lutheran and Norweigian seriously.  [Carleton College](https://www.carleton.edu) also takes itself very seriously, and it might have a space it calls a chapel, but that and some religion courses are the closest it gets to any association with religion.  This and two pretty third rate athletics programs feather the bed for a friendly cross-town rivalry that goes back generations.

## The Legend

Legend has it that a Carleton graduate was a writer for The Golden Girls and the rest writes itself, right?  This writer imagines a rural Minnesota town called [Saint Olaf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_Nylund#St._Olaf).  The town is home to people who, like Rose, are naive but well meaning.  More often than not, that naivete tends towards idiocy.  And in this way a Carleton graduate was able to paint St.Olaf College as a bunch of Scandanavian dummies.  And that prank is in syndication for everyone to enjoy!

If there annals of great acts in college rivalries, this one has to be their epitome.  Prove me wrong.

## The History
There is no historical evidence that this legend is more than a funny story made up by Carl[^2] during [Arbstock](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:F38XhW7Zii4J:https://thecarletonian.com/2020/05/30/drinking-with-the-oles-and-a-t-pain-teapot-sproncert-through-the-decades/+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&client=safari).  I've found a couple internet references to the story ([1](https://www.sitcomsonline.com/boards/showthread.php?t=317520),[2](https://www.city-data.com/forum/minnesota/1162091-fictional-st-olaf-mn-hometown-rose-3.html)), but there are no first-person accounts from anyone in The Golden Girls's writers good that can verify it's more than an amusing yarn.

The IMDB lists the writers on the show from the start (*i.e.*, 1985) as
Susan Harris (Cornell), Winifred Harvey (NI), Barry Fanaro (Mercer College), Mort Nathan (University of Illinois), Terry Grossman (NI), and Kathy Speer (NI).  I've added each writer's *alma mater* parenthetically.  The "NI" means my Googling yeilded no information about where that person went to college.

If you can help find primary sources(*e.g.*, document, people) that can help substantiate this origin story, my Twitter DMs are open.
