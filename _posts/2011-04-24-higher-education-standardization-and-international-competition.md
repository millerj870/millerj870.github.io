Just listened to a <a href="http://www.aacu.org/podcast/feed/153/Ochoa2.mp3">podcast</a> from the 2011 meeting of the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&U) in which Assistant US Secretary of Education, Edward Ochoa, spoke about some current issues. He illuminated for me, for the first time, the importance of the <a href="http://www.luminafoundation.org">Lumnia Foundation's</a> effort to help higher education reach <a href="http://www.luminafoundation.org/state_work.html">state standards</a> for educational attainment levels.

What I learned from Ochoa's remarks (the Q&A at the end is the most informative) is this: the US is playing catch-up with Europe. In 1999, the European Higher Education Area started a process of communicating the meaning of degrees between counties and normalizing measures of educational attainment. This process is called the <a href="http://www.ond.vlaanderen.be/hogeronderwijs/bologna/">Bologna Process</a>, and the Lumnia Foundation appears to be taking the lead in America's effort to do the same.

(This work occurs in the context of the Lumnia Foundation's <a href="http://www.luminafoundation.org/goal_2025.html">Goal 2025</a>.)
