“Let us not rush to the language of healing, before understanding the fullness of the injury and the depth of the wound.<br>
Let us not rush to offer a band-aid, when the gaping wound requires surgery and complete reconstruction.<br>
Let us not offer false equivalencies, thereby diminishing the particular pain being felt in a particular circumstance in a particular historical moment. <br>
Let us not be afraid to sit with the ugliness, the messiness, and the pain that is life.<br>
Let us not offer clichés to the grieving, those whose hearts are being torn asunder.”
