This morning's <a href="http://insiderhighered.com">Inside Higher Ed</a> published an article titled <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/02/17/stem">Graduation Gaps for Science Majors</a>.

> Because some of the largest-ever proportions of students are starting college interested in STEM, Chang said, “all the blame here can’t be placed on K-12 education” for not preparing enough American scientists and engineers, as some workforce experts and politicians argue. </p><p>Instead, much of that blame lies with the nation’s colleges and universities for deterring students somewhere between freshman year and the completion of a bachelor’s degree in four or five years, he said. “Something that happens in college – and it goes beyond just preparation – is losing students.”
