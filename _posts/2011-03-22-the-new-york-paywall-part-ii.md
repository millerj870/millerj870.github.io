title: The New York Paywall, part II
tags:
---

When the New York Times announced its pay wall, the other day, I posted <a href="http://www.jasonemiller.com/the-new-york-paywall">here</a>.  (As a the owner of a free account, I was on their 'list.')  Well, today they've sent me a follow-up note.  Is everyone getting this deal?  There's no way I rate as a 'sqeaky wheel.'

The text of the follow-up email is after the jump.
