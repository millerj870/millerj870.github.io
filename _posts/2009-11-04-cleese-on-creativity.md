title: Cleese on Creativity

Just ran across this video on kungfugrippe.com, Merlin Mann's log of thoughts to the web. The video is of Cleese giving a lecture on being creative. He asserts that the subconscious has a role in creativity, doing work while you are sleeping or otherwise occupied. He also says that the key to getting yourself into a creative flow (not a work he uses) is to give your self boundaries in space (do not let yourself be interrupted) and boundaries in time (let there be a start time for your work and an end time). The video resonated with my beliefs and with what I have been reading lately on creativity.

Guess I should get my office space finished, sooner rather than later. The sabbatical is going to need some serious creation time.
