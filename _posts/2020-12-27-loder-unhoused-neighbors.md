Chad Loder (@chadloder) is on my follow list because he does important work amplifying #GeorgeFloyd demonstrations and the police brutality they unjustly receive from law enforcement.  Today, he posted a Twitter thread (linked at the bottom of this post) on some personal recommendations for supporting your unhoused neighbors.

His thread reminds me of the 'Tactical Caring Kits' that Patrick Skinner (@SkinnerPm), a colorful and thoughtful law enforcement officer in Georgia, has made to help his neighbors.

I'm quote-posting his recommendations as they appeared across several tweets.  A link to the first tweet follows.

>If you’re making care packages for neighbors who are unhoused, here’s some items that are super popular:
>
>* LED headlamps w/ batteries
>
>* Magazines, especially escapist stuff: travel, history, National Geographic, Outside, Popular Mechanics
>
>* Power packs for charging
>
>* Shoes
>
>If you want to really make someone’s day, bring tents and sturdy tarps.
>
>Tents take a beating. People get their tents slashed a lot. Angry face Most folks having to share tents.
>
>Even spare tent-poles come in super handy.
>
>If you’re not camping these days, think about donating your gear
>
>COVID makes it impossible for follks to find any place to charge their “Obama phones” (subsidized mobile phones).
>
>If I had more time, I’d come by with a generator every day and let folks charge up.
>
>Clothes are always welcome.
>
>People seem to have enough toothbrushes and combs.
>
>People never say no to Marlboro Reds. Even just having some loosies to hand out will put a smile on people’s faces.
>
>A cheap styrofoam cooler filled with ice and low-sugar Gatorade is a hit. Leave the ice behind.
>
>Being homeless means you NEVER get anything ice cold or piping hot
>
>If you’re doing hygiene care packages, don’t forget the people who have kinky hair!
>
>Those fine-toothed combs aren’t doing it for folks with Afro-textured hair. Dry shampoo, wide toothed detangler comb, croc clips, some good-smelling detangler spray.
>
>Breathable durags are nice.
>
>Other items that help for fixed encampments:
>
>Lots of trash bags for people to put garbage in.
>
>People with limited mobility have a hard time bringing trash to the dumpsters hundreds of meters from their tent.
>
>Depression and addiction also frankly make this hard for some folks.
>
>Where I live in California, mosquitos and other biting insects are not a big problem.
>
>If mosquito netting is a problem, mosquito netting is a real treat. 
>
>Citronella candles also seem popular. Mosquito repellant, less so - it’s sticky and makes dust and dirt stick to you.
>
>This list is focused on the non-obvious stuff. I think most volunteers know about dental hygiene, wipes, maxi-pads, combs, etc.
>
>Bring a couple bags of dry kibble for dogs, also for cats. Extra flea collars.
>
>Also, dog treats! The camp mutts love the sound of my car now. Face with tears of joy
