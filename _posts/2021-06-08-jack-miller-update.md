Each day Jack continues to grow stronger. Starting Friday, June 4, he began to seem more like himself, saying his mind felt more clear, and his general attitude appeared stronger.  Jack's appetite is good.  Every day he goes for short walks.  He even drove the lawn tractor for a short time on Sunday. 

We got great news Monday, June 7, when the lab tests given June 2, resulted in an even lower level of creatinine: 2.6.  Great news for us. Looking forward to two appointments with Mayo this week and will update following those appointments. Our spirits are good and we thank you for your prayers and your concerns.
