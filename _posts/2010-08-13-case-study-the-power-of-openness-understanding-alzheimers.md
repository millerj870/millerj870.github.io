title: 'Case Study: the power of openness - Understanding Alzheimer’s'
tags: opensource
---

There's been much ado in the last decade about transparency and openness in technology and, in particular, science. The culture of science has been slow to take a ken to openness and sharing. But the NYTimes.com has an <a href="http://nyti.ms/aHRBPA">article</a> today that suggests an open approach to understanding Alzheimer's may be bearing fruit.

>The key to the Alzheimer’s project was an agreement as ambitious as its goal: not just to raise money, not just to do research on a vast scale, but also to share all the data, making every single finding public immediately, available to anyone with a computer anywhere in the world.

The article also has a nice use of the concept of a 'prisoner's dilemma.'
