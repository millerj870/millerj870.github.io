## Selling some LandCruiser Salvage

In July 2023, some noob rear-ended my rig on the freeway.  This was the opening chapter of a story that involved insurance, scrapyards, bodyshops, and a lot of sweat equity on my part.  Part of the story involved me replacing the upper and lower lift gates with parts I contained from a salvage yard.  Between the new gates and my old ruined gates, I had a pair of all the innard (e.g., wiring harnesses, lock mechanisms, latches) and some other stuff.  I don't need these duplicates, so I'm making them available to others inthe Cruiser community who might need them.

Each item has a 'price' next to it.  This figure is half the cost of the same new part listed on this [Toyota Parts Center](https://parts.olathetoyota.com/v-2004-toyota-land-cruiser--base--4-7l-v8-gas/) web site.

All items are sold as-is ... this page has high quality pics you can use to evaluate each piece.  (Click on the thumbnail for a larger image.)  These parts won't be available forever.  

I prefer a buyer 'pick up' the items they pay for, but I'm reluctantly willing to ship.  Buyer will pay the cost of packing and shipping via UPS.


| Item Name | Notes | Price | Image |
|:---|:---|---:|---:|
|Cover for jack crank access | The rig's spare sits up behind the bumper, and just below the lower gate and above the bumper is a little slot.  You pass the hook-end of the crank through this slot to reach the tire lift assembly.  Well, this plastic rectangle is the cover for this slot.  I can't find it in Partsoul or Toyota parts pages.  |$10 |[![](/assets/images/landcruisersale/cover-spare-tire-lift-back-thumbnail.jpeg)](/assets/images/landcruisersale/cover-spare-tire-lift.jpeg) [![](/assets/images/landcruisersale/cover-spare-tire-lift-back-thumbnail.jpeg)](/assets/images/landcruisersale/cover-spare-tire-lift.jpeg)|
