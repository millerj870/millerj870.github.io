Homebrewing became one of my hobbies in 1999.  I started brewing extract kits and eventually learned the skill of all grain brewing.  Living in rual America before the craft beer explosion, homebrewing was the most enjoyable way to get fresh, excellent beer.  Now that I live in Southern California, fresh affordable beer is a short walk from home, and my homebrewing kit has been gathering dust.  It's time my trusty gear find another home so it can help someone else enjoy this craft.

This web page lists my gear that is for sale.  Things are not listed in any 0particular order.  I'll be making another page with more detail (e.g., price, link to comparable catalog item, picture).

All items will also be advertised on Facebook Marketplace and possibly CraigsList (Ventura County).  I'm somewhat willing to haggle and possibly barter.

If anything looks interesting to you, feel free to reach out through Twitter.  The detailed list of items will be posted later today.

Homebrewing Equipment:  Lauter Tun and Mash Tun
tags: beer,maker,homebrew,homebrewing, all grain, equipment

I haven't brewed in a while, so I'm letting my homebrew kitchen go and hope that my tools will help someone else enjoy the craft of brewing.

Essential for all-grain brewing, these insulated containers keep your water and wort at temperature. The mash tun’s false bottom makes it easy to work with large quantities of grains.

I'm posting more items here on FB Marketplace.  I may post on craigslist.  You can see the entire list at http://www.thecoldfish.com/beersale.html.
